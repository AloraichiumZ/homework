    <h1>David Pena</h1>
    <p>I was formally an Electrical Engineer major, but I recently changed to Computer Science as certain circumstances made it difficult for me to continue. 
    Either way, I do hope to learn a lot from this class and the rest of the major.</p>

    <p2>I have an interest in fire alarm systems, the kinds you see in public buildings. Eventually, one small goal I have is that I want to develop open source
    fire alarm control panel software that can be easily made compatible with many new panels.</p2>
